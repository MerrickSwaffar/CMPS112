This program was completed using pair programming.
Merrick Swaffar (mwswaffa@ucsc.edu)
Nishika Tripathi (ntripat1@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone.  Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner.  The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work|into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Merrick Swaffar spent   3 hours working alone.
